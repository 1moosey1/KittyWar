# Sprint 2 Plan

* Product name: Kitty War
* Team name: Dog & Koala Bear

## Goal

* Implement game logic and match-making.
* Construct a working interface that connects to the server.

## User Stories

### As a back-end developer, I want a match-making system that matches two players with the same level of skills.

* (5) Ensure data is properly sent between client and server
* (3) Incorporate logic that determines skill level

### As a back-end developer, I need to implement the games logic (picking characters, drawing cards, using cards against the target) at the server side.

* (0) Have a good day

### As a front-end developer, I need to use APIs provided by the server to send requests and receive responses. Then I make the front-end app update UI and internal data structures according to the returned data from the server.

* (0) Do your best

### As a player, I want to log into a website and view my cards

* (5) Build webpage to display all of this data

### As a player, I want to log into an iPhone app and view my cards
* (5) Build UI centered around signing in and displaying personal saved information
* (5) Ensure custom python server routes login data to database and authenticates the user
