# Sprint 2 Plan

* Product name: Kitty War
* Team name: Dog & Koala Bear

## Goal

* Implement game logic and matchmaking.
* Construct a working interface that connects to the server.

## User Stories

### As a back-end developer, I need to build the match matching system which matches two players with the same level of skills.

### As a back-end developer, I need to implement the games logic (picking characters, drawing cards, using cards against the target) at the server side.

### As a front-end developer, I need to use APIs provided by the server to send requests and receive responses. Then I make the front-end app update UI and internal data structures according to the returned data from the server.
